# ts-spellchecker

This project is a simple ts-spellchecker which should be as much performant as possible. It's written in Nuxt3 - but can be adapted to every other as well. Examples attached!
You will need to set up a LanguageTool API (Documentation for this is WIP)

## Setup

```bash
# bun
bun install

# .env
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
# IMPLEMENT API KEY
```

## Development Server
```bash
# bun
bun run dev
```
